<p id="about">About Youtuber <span id="Happy">Yoga With Adriene</span>
 With over 4.8 million subscribers, Adriene Mishler is the undisputed queen of YouTube yoga. Quirky, down-to-earth, and very much someone that you’d want to be best friends with, it’s not surprising that Mishler has a fiercely loyal following. When I’m “in a mood,” she’s my go-to pick-me-up; her light-hearted, refreshing presence usually dissolves said mood within minutes.
